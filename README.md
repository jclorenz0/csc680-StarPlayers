# StarPlayers
## Description
My iOS final project for CSC 680. A simple NBA player statistics tracker. Implements the APIs from https://www.balldontlie.io/.

**Author: Jaycee Lorenzo**
## Purpose
As a working college student with many hobbies, it's difficult to find time for my personal interests during the year, especially watching NBA games. I never enjoyed tediously navigating popular sports applications to find simple statistics for my favorite NBA players. My goal for this project is to create an application with a stripped, but still user friendly interface for users to easily view their favorite players' performance for the current regular season. Future plans include expanding to other professional sports leagues such as NFL and MLB, including team data, and game data.
## Prerequisites
This application was originally meant to be run locally with the user's own API key from https://www.balldontlie.io/. In order to get full functionality from the application, the user must have a premium tier from the API site. I will push the API keys for the sake of the professor's review/grading purposes, but will make the repository private once grading is finalized.
## Instructions
Instructions are displayed throughout the application. Below will be documentation the user can refer to get the most out of StarPlayers.
### Adding a Player to your list
1. Navigate to the "Search for Player" tab using the bottom navigation bar. OR Click "+ Add Player" button at the bottom of the list in the "Player List" tab.
2. Search for player by first name OR last name as the request will not work for full name.
3. Click desired player to add to your list!
4. The player's statistics will be available for viewing in the "Player List" tab.
### Removing a Player from your list
1. Simply click the player you want to remove.
2. The application will prompt you to confirm whether or not you want to delete the player.
3. Changes will be reflected immediately after deletion.

## Special Thanks
